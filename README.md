# 🧾 InScripts React Internship Assignment – Spreadsheet UI Clone

This project is a **static, front-end-only React prototype** that visually matches the provided Figma screenshot of a spreadsheet interface.  
It simulates a mini-Excel/Google Sheets experience as per the assignment requirements using **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

> **Goal:**  
Create a pixel-perfect, static React implementation of the spreadsheet view UI as per the design shared in the Figma file.

> **Tech Stack Used:**
- React 18 (with Vite)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Icons
- No backend or state management library used
- Minimal custom logic, focused on layout and styling fidelity

---

## 🎓 What I Learned

During this project, I significantly improved my **frontend development skills**, especially:

- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling for pixel-perfect layouts
- Creating reusable components in React (e.g., Badge, Header, Toolbar)
- JSX + TypeScript strict mode usage
- Flexbox/Grid layouts with Tailwind
- Clean folder structuring for scale
- Git + GitHub CLI usage
- Running TypeScript checks & linting with ESLint
